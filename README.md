# Cahier

Stylus notes on an **Omarchy lectern**. Cahier is a native Rust and egui app for handwritten notes, sketches, and diagrams.

The **shelf** holds your notebooks; each notebook opens onto a page with paper, drawing tools, and a ruler. The interface follows the active Omarchy theme, while the paper keeps its own look.

Your notes stay on your computer in `~/.local/share/omacourses`. Cahier needs no account or network connection.

## What's New

### Multi-page notebooks, two ways to read them

Add pages around the current sheet. Display them edge to edge in *Linked* mode, or keep a gap between them in *Separate* mode.

</p>

Use the `+` tabs to add a page along any free edge.

### Paper for every idea

Choose lined, grid, dotted, graph, or blank paper. Canson paper adds a subtle texture to notes and sketches.

### A shelf and a bin

Keep your notebooks on the shelf and restore any you have moved to the bin.

## Run

### Install (Arch Linux / Omarchy)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudDown/omacourses/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer checks runtime libraries, including `fc-match` from fontconfig, asks before installing any that are missing, downloads the latest release binary, and puts `cahier` in `~/.local/bin`. It also installs a desktop entry and icon (`com.clouddown.cahier`) so Cahier appears in the application menu.

Compile `main` from source instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudDown/omacourses/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --from-source
```

Remove the binary, desktop entry, and icon:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudDown/omacourses/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

Other Linux distributions work when the graphics libraries are already installed. `--from-source` also needs Rust and Cargo.

```bash
cargo run --release
cahier --help
cahier --data-dir
```

Binary: `cahier`. Data: `~/.local/share/omacourses` (or `$CAHIER_DATA`).

```bash
CAHIER_OPEN=Mindset cahier   # open a notebook by title
```

Theme read from `omarchy theme current` / `colors.toml`.

### Hyprland

Optional keybinding in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```ini
bind = SUPER, N, exec, cahier
```

The window uses app id `com.clouddown.cahier`, the same value as `StartupWMClass` in the desktop file. Example window rule:

```ini
windowrule = float, class:^(com\.clouddown\.cahier)$
```

## Gestures

The lectern follows the stylus: in range, the hand pans and the nib writes. Put it down, the mouse writes again.

| | Mouse | Stylus in range |
|---|---|---|
| Writes | mouse | stylus |
| Pan | space + drag, middle-click, trackpad | finger, two-finger drag |
| Eraser | right-click hold (last kind), `e` / `shift+e` | stylus button hold, air-click to toggle |
| Undo | `ctrl+z` | two-finger tap |
| Zoom | pinch, two-finger trackpad, `+` `−` | pinch |

| | |
|---|---|
| `p` `b` `c` `h` | felt-tip, fountain pen, pencil, highlighter |
| `e` / `shift+e` | stroke (whole stroke) / area (under cursor) |
| `l` `t` `i` | lasso, text, image |
| `[` `]` `1-9` | thickness, ink |
| `m` | cycle paper (blank, lined, grid, dotted, graph, slate) |
| corners / `0` / click on % | fit to screen |
| hold the pen still ~1s | line / arrow / triangle / square / diamond / ellipse / circle |
| `ctrl+s` | save |
| `ctrl+e` `ctrl+shift+e` | PNG, PDF |

### Shelf

| | |
|---|---|
| Right-click a spine (or hold a finger) | spine wheel — pin, color, trash, mark |
| Wastebasket | open / close the bin row |
| Drag onto the bin (or a bin cell) | trash the notebook |
| Drag out of the bin | restore to the shelf |
| Two-finger drag on the shelf | scroll |

### Pages

| | |
|---|---|
| `+` on a free edge | add a unit page there |
| Fold corner (when more than one unit) | tear that unit off |
| ⋯ → Linked / Separate | flush sheet vs gutter between pages |

First launch: notebooks *Mindset* and *Art direction*.
